  Check this option to add all signed APKs this build step <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-signing-plugin#usage">generates</a>
  to the build's archived artifacts.  If you don't want this step to archive the signed APK artifacts, downstream build steps can access signed APKs in the
  workspace at paths like <code>SignApksBuilder-out/myApp-unsigned.apk/myApp-signed.apk</code>, where <code>myApp-unsigned.apk</code> is a directory named
  for the input unsigned APK.
